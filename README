wrf2kmz.py
Jonathan Beezley <jon.beezley@gmail.com>

This is a commandline script and python module that will generate
Google Earth visualizations from surface variables in WRF output 
files.  The script syntax is simply:

python wrf2kmz.py wrfout [var1 [var2 [...]]]

A file called wrf.kmz will be created containing ground overlays
for all of the surface variables (var1, etc) specified on the
commandline.  

See the docstrings in the file for information on how to customize the output
or to add the ability to visualize netCDF files generated by other models.

Dependencies:

    simplekml      : http://code.google.com/p/simplekml/
    matplotlib     : http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
    netcdf4-python : http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/

WARNING:  KMZ files expect that ground overlays are unprojected, but
WRF models can output on a variety of projections.  There is an experimental
reprojection component that is turned of by default.  You can try
to enable this by setting no_reprojection=True in the source.  There
are two methods for reprojection.  The first is a custom fortran module
that requires a working installation of f2py.  The second is used if
the fortran module cannot be compiled.  It uses a call to matplotlib's
griddate function and is significantly slower on large domains.
