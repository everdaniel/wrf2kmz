wrf2kmz.py
Jonathan Beezley <jon.beezley@gmail.com>

This is a commandline script and python module that will generate
Google Earth visualizations from surface variables in WRF output 
files.  The script syntax is simply:

python wrf2kmz.py wrfout [var1 [var2 [...]]]

A file called wrf.kmz will be created containing ground overlays
for all of the surface variables (var1, etc) specified on the
commandline.  

See the docstrings in the file for information on how to customize the output
or to add the ability to visualize netCDF files generated by other models.

Dependencies:

    simplekml      : http://code.google.com/p/simplekml/
    matplotlib     : http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
    netcdf4-python : http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/

WARNING:  KMZ files expect that ground overlays are unprojected, but
WRF models can output on a variety of projections.  At this time, this file will
not unproject data for ground overlays.  So, if your WRF simulation occurs using 
anything other than regular_ll, the georeferencing will be incorrect.  For the small
domains (order 10 km) typically used in fire simulations, this error is typically
quite small (less than the mesh resolution).  In the future, I plan to add an optional
image reprojecting component based off of gdal python bindings.
